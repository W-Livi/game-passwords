retro games password interpreters/generators

Over the years I've written a handful of password generators for older video games. Some of these are wholly original works, based off my own experimentation; some are built on top of guides written by others. None of them are particularly flashy, any my javascript probably isn't the cleanest, but they should at least _work_.
