	<h1>WLivi's retro game password generators</h1>
	<p>Over the years I've written a handful of password generators for older video games. Some of these are wholly original works, based off my own experimentation; some are built on top of guides written by others. None of them are particularly flashy, and my javascript probably isn't the cleanest, but they should at least <em>work</em>.</o>
